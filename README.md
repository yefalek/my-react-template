### Get started in seconds
Whether youâ€™re using React or another library, Create React App lets you focus on code, not build tools.

To create a project called my-app, run this command:

`npx create-react-app my-app`
`npx create-react-app .` //in current folder

### Easy to Maintain
Updating your build tooling is typically a daunting and time-consuming task. When new versions of Create React App are released, you can upgrade using a single command:

Copy
`npm install react-scripts@latest`
